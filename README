__Project Overview__

This project is a browser-based slot machine game that I extended with an AI-driven “Next Bet Recommendation” feature. 
The game itself is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while a Node.js/Express backend uses the OpenAI API to analyze the player’s current balance 
and betting pattern and return a suggested bet amount. This shows how I use LLMs APIs to augment even the simplest interactive 
applications with intelligent behavior. I built this project to demonstrate my ability to integrate AI into existing codebases quickly and creatively, 
transforming a basic game into something more dynamic and adaptive.

Tools used: Node.js, Express, OpenAI API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
